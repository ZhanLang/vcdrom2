WinCDEmu allows mounting CD/DVD/BD images directly from Explorer.

Just double-click (or press ENTER) on a CD/DVD/BD image in Explorer and a virtual drive will appear in your system. To unmount an image, double-click on an image file again, or eject the virtual disc.
You can mount simultaneously as many images as you want. Each image will appear as an additional CDROM drive.
Additionally, you can mount images from the command-line by calling "vmnt.exe <image path>".

To perform unattended installation, invoke this file with /UNATTENDED option. Note that unless you have disabled unsigned driver warnings, you will still be prompted for installing the driver.
